# Sustain

## Overview
Sustain is a website for Campus Student Sustainability Initiatives. Campus Student Sustainability Initiatives (CSSI) is an ASU student organization that incorporates volunteering opportunities and sustainability initiative on campus. Sustain will be revamping the current website for CSSI by updating the visual design, appeal, and simplicity. Not only will Sustain be “revamping” the site, but will also incorporate digital marketing elements, search engine optimization, and (if time allows) taking on other sustainability clubs who need assistance with web development.

**User Feedback
*Background: Had random end users (friends, coworkers, and family) navigate through the CSSI sample website
to evaluate the styling, functionality, and various features to seek feedback on some positives and negatives
associated with the site. Below are some of the comments that we received related to the web design.

* Positives:
* [1] Color scheme fit well with the other features of site and for the club's theme
* [2] Text font was easily readable and seemed to fit, wasn't too fancy
* [3] Site wasn't too "busy". Wasn't overwhellmed by content
* [4] Navagation bar was sleek and easy to use, enjoyed that text changes color upon hover
* [5] Enjoyed the asu search bar, made the site feel more official
* [6] Google map feature was a nice touch to site
 
*Negatives:
* [1] Wished that content had been actual content, even if it wasn't accurate
* [2] Difficult to navigate the ABOUT tab in the top tool bar
* [3] Seemed that it would be difficult to locate certain content when site was live, had too many similar tabs
* [4] wished that certain content was spaced out better to fill the entire page
* [5] Pictures on home marquee are not the best quality
* [6] Text in the scroll bar for "what CSSI is" is hard to read, make it bold
